                    Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a freesociety, transparency is 
                    government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens hold their 
                    public officials accountable. 
                    Here at TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business
                    and spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows
                    good and just governance. 
                    Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's effectiveness 
                    and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, and public officials benefit 
                    from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become actively engaged in American government.

                    TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit public feedback to identify 
                    information of greatest use to the public.

                <p class="text-justify">
                  In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and
                  susceptible to public opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many
                  philosophes made an attack on absolutist doctrine of state
                  secrecy, a
                  core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative instruments to this end
                  can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland as a
                  Swedish-governed territory) enacting
                  free
                  press
                  legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of
                  the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century
                  public sphere.

                  <p class="text-justify">Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and
                    France (1789), freedom of the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary
                    accounting and freedom of the press in constitutional
                    articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures were
                    vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton
                    prominent among the latter.</p>

                  <p class="text-justify">Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary
                    democratic practice and is often linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation.
                    Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted the first freedom of
                    information
                    legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland
                    continuing the presumption of openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on
                    Publicity of Official Documents in 1951
                    (superseded
                    by new legislation in 1999).</p>

                  <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
                    Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.</p>
